# :shell: 0x1B - C: Big O & Sorting Algorithms :shell:

In this project I will be learning more about Big O notation as well as sorting algorithms. Specifically, bubble, insertion, selection, and most importantly quick sort. I will be learning the various Big O notations for these algorithms as well as gain the ability to generate Big O notations for any function I come across.


## :warning: Prerequisites

* Must have `git` installed

* Must have repository cloned

* Must have `gcc` installed

```
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

Compile with:
```
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra X-main.c X-problem.c -o X-output
```
Where X is the problem number for files that are relevant
